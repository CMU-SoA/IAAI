                <h3>Phase 1 - Precedent Research & Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    The first phase in the project looked at The Highline Park in 
                    Manhattan, New York as the primary subject of precedent research 
                    before looking at the Pittsburgh stpes as sites for research and 
                    design.

                <h3>Phase 2 - Site Mapping and Research</h3>
                <p>
                    The second phase in the project was focused on analyzing and 
                    mapping the Pittsburgh steps as part of the city's circulation 
                    to identify opportunities for urban revitalization. We formed
                    teams of two, and each team focused on one Pittsburgh 
                    neighborhood.

                <h3>Phase 3 - Field Research</h3>
                <p>
                    The third phase in the project allows each team to engage in 
                    hands-on work by choosing one of three issues (construction,
                    ecology, and experience) to develop further research material
                    regarding the current state of the Pittsburgh steps.
